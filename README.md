- 👋 Hi Everyone!!! 

- I’m Agustin Carrizo Del Rio. I'm a Mechanical Engineer student finishing my studies in the Universidad Nacional de Tucumán and currently working in a 
  tech company as an IT Consultant and also working with personal projects as a frelancer web developer.
  I am always learning new things in the mechanical engineer field and in the tech and software fields.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a Full-Stack Developer at the Rolling Code School based in Tucumán.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project I can put hands into so you can reach me via my personal Email or via my Linkedin, you can see them in my GitHub profile page.
